In this project, we have to classify handwritten digits using different classifiers. Different classifiers used are:
1.	Linear classifier
2.	K-nearest neighbor classifier 
3.	Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network 
4.	One-hidden layer fully connected multilayer neural network
5.	Two-hidden layer fully connected multilayer neural network. 

Out of these, only K-nearest neighbor classifier is unsupervised learning algorithm and others are supervised learning algorithms. 
Also, 3 extra classifiers used are: 
1.	Decision Tree 
2.	Random Forest classifier 
3.	RBM

Both the files "EE-258 Project-1(2).ipynb" and "EE-258 Project-1.ipynb" are jupter notebooks so run it in a jupyter notebooks.

Requirements of the Jupter notebook:
Library like scikit learn, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib should be installed.

Computational speeds will vary depend on the computation power.
